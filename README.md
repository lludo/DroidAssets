DroidAssets
============

DroidAssets allows you to generate all the assets you need for your Android application in record time. Drag-and-drop an asset from the res/drawable-{density} folder, and this asset will be generated for all the other densities you need. This works not only for simple PNG's, but also 9-patches.

- Resize PNG assets
- Regenerate 9-patches for reduced images
- Place the generated images in the right drawable folder

It's open source and free to download on [MacUpdate](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/48592/droidassets).
